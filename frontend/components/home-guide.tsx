          Share your location and Searches look near you unless you name a place. Add your Taste
          by connecting Spotify or importing from Last.fm, ListenBrainz or a list, and we can find
          Concerts for the Artists you already play. With Spotify and your location, this page also
          shows your Artists near you for the next two months.
